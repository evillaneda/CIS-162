    <p>My name is Eric Villaneda and I am a student at Cerritos College. I am currently majoring in Computer Science. This is my 3rd year at this college and I am one year away from finishing and transferring to a 4-year college. I am taking only 2 classes this semester but will have to take 4 in the spring to stay on schedule to earn my AA next fall. I hope I can do well in this class so I am not held back any longer.</p>
